# Alphabet-Roulette
A modified roulette game with letters of the alphabet and start and stop buttons. 

# What This Project Does: 

In this Roulette game, there are three boxes: one for a user to enter their guess by pressing any of the alphabet keys on their keyboard, one which houses the spinning wheel and 
a third which displays the letter the wheel lands on. There are two buttons, "Spin!" and "Stop" which the user can use to spin the wheel and to stop it. Once the user presses
"stop", the wheel will slowly decelerate and a wedge on the side of the wheel's box will mark the letter which the wheel has fallen on. 
After the "Spin!" button has been pressed, the user cannot update their guess for what the wheel will land on.

# What This Project is Made Of: 

This Roulette Game has been made using HTML/CSS/Javascript(&jQuery). All the basic functionality of the Roulette Wheel is in the file "index3.js".
